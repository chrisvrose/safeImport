Handle aliasing as a important piece in draft
Please note down problem exploration

### My single lib analysis.

- [X] Scan a library. Get its dependencies.
- [X] Call for its dependencies. Webpack them into individual files.
  - [X] Optional: Use webpack to push them all into one lib file
  - [X] Slice this lib for packages
  - [X] Replace/proxy them and then unit test them.


### Multi lib analysis

TODOs:
- [ ] CVE test
- [ ] ORBS testing
- [ ] Report writing


### Requirements further

- [X] Get some sort of require("") thing running.  P1
  - [X] Find out how many of these projects use require instead of import.
- [X] Try to find a way to test the slicing given some cherry-picked libraries that work. P1
- [ ] CVE Removal (doubtful) -> Document the thing.
- [ ] ORBs testing

- [ ] Report writing


Remember: Slicing within 10m limit was set
