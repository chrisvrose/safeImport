Handle aliasing as a important piece in draft
Please note down problem exploration



### Repo mining

-> Get list of all packages
-> >50000 downloads
-> filter by package.json exists in root
-> filter by test libs
-> filter away typescript -> existence of tsconfig.json


-> filter by unsliceable libs (?)


### My single lib analysis.

- [ ] Scan a library. Get its dependencies.
- [ ] Call for its dependencies. Webpack them into individual files.
  - [ ] Optional: Use webpack to push them all into one lib file
  - [ ] Slice this lib for packages
  - [ ] Replace/proxy them and then unit test them.
